Escalators and passenger elevators are used by the general public and should not be blocked or used to transport equipment or freight. The lobby areas, escalators, and passenger elevators are not to be used for move-in or move-out purposes.

The North Facility Freight Elevator, located on the north dock, provides access to Ballrooms D-G and Meeting Rooms 11-19. When Ballrooms D-G are being used for exhibits, the freight elevator requires an operator. The operator must be provided by the Austin Convention Center Department at the prevailing rate and is charged to the client. Please ask your Event Coordinator if you have any questions about elevator and/or escalator capacity.
